# Ape Society Amphitheatre Armoury dApp

## What is this?
This react app is where Ape Society Amphitheatre users can undergo loadout management, match scheduling, and eventually use as an Amphitheatre gear inventory system that queries a user's cardano wallet and allows a user to equip onchain gear onto different slots (armor, weapon, mount, etc.)

More to come on the documentation.
