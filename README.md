# Ape Society Amphitheatre Armoury dApp

## What is this?
This react app is where Ape Society Amphitheatre users can undergo loadout management, match scheduling, and eventually use as an Amphitheatre gear inventory system that queries a user's cardano wallet and allows a user to equip onchain gear onto different slots (armor, weapon, mount, etc.)

## How to Contribute ##
To help incentivize developers, we offer "bounties" to build out different aspects of the app. By completing bounties, developers can earn various Cardano native tokens that can be used in the Ape Society ecosystem. The communication and requirements for these bounties are coordinated via discord. Come Join our Discord @ https://discord.gg/pMZJH4nkhF
